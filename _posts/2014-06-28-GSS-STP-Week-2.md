Snapshot

I was sick all week and was pretty frustrated. I felt distant from my guys, and wasn't doing much. I didn't feel excited or motivated but God worked through it. I had some great conversations in my one-on-ones and evangelism at CSUF this week. People really took care of me and got me things while I was sick =].

My thoughts
-------------
I was pretty **sick** this week and was bummed about it. I learned more about the power of rest and trusting God in taking care of myself over others. I am pretty stubborn and I think rest is just an ongoing battle in my life. I want people to know that I am excited for them and want to be in their lives; it's hard to say no.

This week in **evangelism** at CSUF, we had some good conversations with people on campus. It was encouraging because we had a couple natural conversations. People we willing to talk to us about their story. We even got to share the bridge with a few of them. It was interesting,  Kael was my partner this week and he called me out. He noticed that I wasn't willing to share the true theme of the Bible with people who missed it. I was afraid of them lashing out; or turning away from seeking God. I wanted to be gentle and I didn't want to offend them. **People pleasing** is something I struggle with, and want to find freedom in. The real theme of the Bible is good news for us all. It's **grace**, we no longer have to try to meet an impossible standard and can have freedom to grow in joy.

Here is what our evangelism looks like:

1. Ask students if they'd like to take a **30 second survey** answering three questions
	1. What is your spiritual background?
	2. What is your current religion?
	3. What do you think the main theme of the Bible is? Most people will answer "Being a good person." 
2. We ask them if we can share a 5 minute illustration of what the main theme of the Bible is.
	We share **The Bridge** with them. It focuses around **Romans 6:23** and break it into three parts.
		1. Our deserve(wages) death(Hell) for our sins(disobeying God)
		2. God offers us a gift(undeserved) of enternal life(Heaven)
		3. Jesus paid our debt(wages) by humiliating himself and dying on the cross for our sins
> "For the wages of sin is death but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 6:23

Last Words
-------------
Each guy team this week took out a girls team on a fun date. The heart behind it was to honor these women and be a blessing to them. We had Rachel's team (Tiffany, Jordan, and Hannah). We took them to Huntington Beach and took them to Ruby's on the pier. These girls ended up really encouraging us. Firing question after question, and being interested in who we were. It ended up being a great time and all the guys were stoked. I struggle with feeling like I can be a blessing to girls. I feel inadequate; but I'm so thankful we were able to be uncomfortable and this with them!

I'm feeling a lot better now. Thank you all for your prayers. I have so much more energy and I'm stoked on that! We had **parents weekend** this weekend, so I got to spend time with my Aunt and cousin from Alabama, along with my parents =]. I got to take a few people from STP to my church Sunday =]. It was great having them meet some of the people who have played a huge role in my life.

Rich sat in our bible study, and my one-on-one with Dean this week to evaluate me on how I could improve as a leader. I'm excited to see what he has to say. I'll fill you guys more in on that next week. Rich really has this **boldness** with sharing about Jesus. He accepted God into his life in college while he was smoking a bong with his friend. He has a lot of interesting stories and I love his heart for wanting other to have what he has.

If you have any questions please feel free to write me =]. I hope to write a longer post next week. It's hard balancing everything. Being an adult is so lame. Don't be a stranger!!

Prayer
-------------

- Jobs. Neri and Kael started work at Knotts this week. Macklin has been getting temp jobs through an agency called Man Power. **Dean** still hasn't been able to get work. Please pray for a job for him. If people do not find jobs this week, they will begin volunteering at a local community center. We are thankful that they will still be able to work!
- Fundraising. Neri, Kael, and Dean are still in fundraising mode and are in need of funds (tonight they need to be at 75% and they are not quite there). I love seeing them trying and still going after it. Their perserverence is encouraging. I am going to try and reach out this week!
- Sickness. All better
- Personal Evangelism. I was challenged by my Shepparder Rich to go out and seek the people at FUV(our apartment complex). There are students here from all over the globe. I got to meet James, Joey, and Trevor Sunday. I just don't feel motivated to do it right now; but I want to to keep going after these guys. - Romans 1:16
