Snapshot
------------
Time is coming to a close here at GSS. All the team members leave this Wednesday(7/30) and team leaders leaves Friday(8/1). I miss you guys and wanted to catch you guys up on what has been going on =].

My Thoughts
-------------
Same things have been going on. This week I've been having my last **one on ones** with each of the guys. It's been awesome seeing what they've been overcoming this summer (laziness, pride, legalism, performance, insignificance, patience, humility, making time for God amongst a busy life (working 40 hrs a week). I don't like confrontation, but I see more and more of how important it is. I hate it when people critize me (in confrontation); I take it to mean that I'm a failure and drag myself down. I really want to grow out of this mindset. People are trying to help me not hurt me. Beating myself up, prevents me from growing in all areas of my life. It also causes me not to want to confront people because I don't want people to feel the way I do.

>"...He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him..." Acts 18:26,27

In Bible study last week, I love how **Apollos** in Acts 18:24-28 was so stoked to preach the Gospel in Ephesus; but he was actually leading people astray. When Priscilla and Aquila corrected him, he kept going and was encouraged to keep going. The spoke to him in love and truth =].

Evangelism
-------------
My team has been challenging eachother to share our testimonies and the Gospel at our jobs and the apartment complex we've been living at. The guys have been going above and beyond at this. Macklin, has even started reading the Bible with one of his coworkers =]! They've really pushed me in this area more than I've pushed them. It's exciting and encouraging!

I've noticed one of my friends, Ruben, has been playing guitar at the pool of our apartment complex(FUV) every night. He's gotten to know a lot of the residents at FUV through it, so I wanted to try it =]. Last Tuesday, I decided to play guitar at night and met Muhammed. We got to talk and we ended up talking about his religious background(Islam) because one of the GSSers, Devin, has been asking him hard questions. I got to ask what he thought he deserved for his sins. It was sweet explaining how we deserve death for our sins and how Jesus dying on the cross paid for our mistakes and faults. I've enjoyed talking to him here and there FUV but haven't had another solid conversation with him.

I started work at UCI this past week as a Peer Academic Advisor (PAA). Once a week, I get to help incoming freshmen at UCI's orientation. We give them and presentation, break for lunch, and then help them sign up for classes. I got to have lunch with one of my coworkers. We were able to talk about God and how she struggles with a Christian mom and Hindu dad. She says she reads the Bible and feels like God is speaking directly to her. I've been thinking about reading the Bible with her one week, and trying to bring her out to Navs. It's so cool getting to use what I've learned at GSS, and having more of a longing to ask her about her spirtual background.

Last Words
-------------
We only have about a half a week left at GSS. It has been a challenge but also super exciting. I will be writing an email of what I've taken from GSS next week. The next couple days will include our last Bible study, our last Bible study, our last work days, debriefing, XTAGS(Extended Time Alone with God 3 hours tues,weds), and a Banquet Tuesday before all the team members leave. Thank you all for praying for me and partnering with me this summer. I am so stoked you, I had you guys. I enjoyed your emails and excitement for what I've been learning =]. Thank you for reading all of these posts. 

We had our last one on ones this week. Our lessons was about Matthew 28:18-20, how we are all called to go out and disciple of all nations (all people). We are all challenging ourselves to go out on campus next year and disciple one man (2 Tim 2:2). Please be praying for this!

We got to have a team date on Friday--this is rare for our team. Our work schedules make it difficult for us all to be together daily. We got to share our testimonies and the guys felt comfortable to open up about their struggles, sharing their mess ups and the shame they have felt from it. We were able to encourage eachother. This meant a lot to me because I had a similar experience in Japan with my team (it really helped me). It was cool just seeing them open up and getting closer with all of them =] (Matt 18:20).

Prayer
-------------

- With all your prayer and support we were able to fully fund my team =]. You should have seen the guys faces!! They couldn't believe how God provided (through you guys) for them! Thank you all so much for sacrificing for these. It was a super huge blessing for them all and you all have been blessed =]. We were able to get $1000 extra dollars to give to my team.
- Prayer for finishing strong. I'm still struggling with thinking about how we are almost at the end. It is hard to stay present. God can still do great things in these last days =]. Proverbs 3:5,6.
- Prayer for one last conversation with one of the guys on my team about legalism.
