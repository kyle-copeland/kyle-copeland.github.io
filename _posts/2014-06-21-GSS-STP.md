My thoughts
-------------
This was a pretty packed week; but man am I excited to be here. I feel really cared for by the staff and am learning a lot from my team and God! 

Thank you all for praying for me! I have had an **action packed week**: three days of straight information (Sun-Tues), moving into a new place, getting to know my team/apartment, getting to know the other 80 students here, going back to work, bible studies, workshops, and fun!

I feel really cared for here at GSS because they are really taking care of us here! Here are some of the things they are doing for us!
1. Every Sunday I will have time with staff to talk about struggles as a team leader.
2. Every Sunday I will have a few hours to go off somewhere and get extended time with God(XTAG).
3. I have an assigned staff member who will be checking in with how I'm doing personally (Rich, he's amazing).
4. I will have weekly workshops on practices to pass on to my team members (scripture memory, prayer, ect).
5. I will have weekly bible studies with other team leaders to prepare a similar bible study with my team members.
6. Every Saturday is a free day and I have no obligations

My Team
-------------
My team is pretty rockin! Dean is a strong man who loves organizing events to bring people together. You can hear his love for God in his prayers and singing. We have Neri, who is willing to step out and do uncomfortable things for the better of people (he also shreds the guitar). He is trusting God with a lot of adversity in his path! Kael is super artistic, passionate, and curious man that is seeking the LORD(he also plays guitar)! Macklin is taller than me... but despite this he is a born leader and is super passionate about apologetics (he also plays trumpet).

My team is made up of individuals who all **offer** different abilities. It's going to be so powerful this summer if we are all able to work together and spur eachother on.

> "And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching." - Hebrews 10:24-25

My team is not perfect; but what I see in their shortcomings, I see and have seen those same struggles in my own life. I love how I get to use the pains, struggles, and joys of my life to spur on this group of guys. These guys have been faced with some pretty **hopeless seasons** of life and they have been an encouragement for my life. They have all been vulnerable in opening up to me about what they are going through. I get to have **one-on-one time** with each of them every week. They are so cool! I wish I was as cool as them =].

Activities
-------------
All activities are done with Dean, Kael, Macklin, and Neri =]. We share the same apartment also!!

We got to **evangelize at CSUF** Thursday. It was uncomfortable for us all. I was encouraged by how the guys were excited to go out. We were all uncomfortable together (what a great place to be in)! Dean and Macklin met a man named Randell. He was jaded by how people kept telling them he was going to Hell and the guys were able to combat the lies in Randell's life. They guys are going to hopefully meet up with Randell Monday if he is still willing! Please pray for this!!! Kael got to do evangelism with Rich (staff from University of Arizona). I think it was Kael's first time evangelizing like this. He couldn't stop talking about how awesome his experience was with Rich. He went from super doubtful to stoked to do it again! They had 15-20 minute conversations with two students there. Rich is pretty wise with evangelism. He told Kael "It's okay if you get lost for words; just think of an answer for next time." Rich has this mentality of **refinement** that I want to pursue.

We had **bible study** Friday on Acts 1-2. This whole summer **we will be going through Acts**; the staff were sharing their heart about how Acts is a book of exactly what we will be doing this summer. I learned a lot through Acts a few years ago and I'm excited to learn more =]. This Friday was my first time leading a group of guys in a study. That was an exciting experience for me. I struggle with a desire to impress and please others. As I was preparing for the study this same feeling came to me again. "Oh man I need to prepare more so I respected by my group." The Spirit helped me find freedom in this. A staff member from UCI Navs prayed 1 Corinthians 1-10 for me before I left and I wanted to share it with the guys. We started off the Bible study pondering these verses and Hebrews 10:24-25. I want them to know we aren't here to be the better person. We are here to spur on one another and share how the Spirit has been moving in our own lives. It has been cool leading the study because I get to help set the stage for freedom for these guys.

I also worked and had a few meetings! 

Last Words
-------------
My friend Simon (he's another Quarter Team Leader) mentioned how he wants to lead by **vulnerability**. Man that would be so cool! I don't want to fall into the cycle of needing to meet someone elses expectations. The only way I am going to be able to love these guys is by loving God first. This week I am going to work on memorizing a part of John 15 with Macklin. I continue to see the power of falling more and more in love with God. 

Prayer
-------------

- **Jobs Jobs Jobs**. All of us as part of these trip are trying to get part time jobs. Since this is only a 6 week commitment, companies are less likely to hire. Dean and Macklin as well as 50% of the other guys here are still in need of jobs. Time is running out and we are praying that God would provide. Wed-Fri the unemployed people are having an hour devotional for jobs and then going out looking for jobs!
- **Fundraising**!!! I am currently at 125%!!! Yay! Thank you guys so much. You are all as big a part of this summer as I am. Our team and others are still struggling. Each Wednesday night we get together to send out more letters and encourage one another. If any of you are feeling called to give more that would be a huge blessing to these guys. 
- Dean and Macklin would have an opportunity to talk with Randell (student met through evangelism at CSUF)
- That I would seek God **first**. John 15:1-17
- I would remember this **Psalm 34:4-5**
- I want to **love my team** more and more. I want to see more of what God sees in these guys and encourage them =]. More open opportunities to talk.
- My team would **believe in eachother** and spur one another on. That they would not need to impress eachother but that they would be genuinely be stoked for eachother! Heb 10:24-25
