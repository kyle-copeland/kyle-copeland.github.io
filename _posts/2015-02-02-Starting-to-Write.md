This is why I want to start writing
------------------------------

I want to start writing to get my thoughts on paper. I want to start writing to reflect. I want to start writing to share my life in a different way with you. I want to start writing to motivate myself to take more photos, write more software, and make more art. I want to start writing to encourage others--to let you know you aren't alone. I want to start writing to share my faith with others in a safe place. I want start writing to share with others what I have learned. I want to start writing to look cool. I want to start writing because I want people to be interested in my life. I want to start writing because I have things to offer others. I want to start writing because it is a good thing. I want to start writing because I can hardly get my thoughts together when talking to people. I want to start writing.
