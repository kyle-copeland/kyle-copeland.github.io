Snapshot
------------
Each week here at STP has been different. Week 1 I learned a lot about **rest**, Week 2 was trusting that I could be significant while being **sick**. Week 3-4 I have been learning about **fellowship** and **communion** with God.

Events
-------------
- One on ones with Kael, Dean, Macklin, and Neri on **Quiet Times/Fellowship**(We had two topics this week Mark 1:35/Heb 10:24-25) (Week 3) and **Promises and Assurances from God** (2 Peter 1:3-4) (Week 4)
- One on ones with Rich. We went through the evaluation of our Bible study and one on one. 
- Team Leader Shepherding (Talk on performance Matthew 24)
- ETAG - 3 hours
- Team Bible Study Acts 8-12 (Week 3)/ Acts 13-15 (Coming this Sunday)
- Everyone went Fullerton High School to the city's yearly firework show on **July 4th**
- Team **Evangelism** at **CSUF** on July 4th (we met one guy Andrew). Went to **UCI** July 10th with 20 other people from STP. Prayed for different areas of the campus and evangelized in the international center. We got to have some good conversations with Abraham, Abdul, Ali, and Muhammad for 10 minutes and a guy named Carlos for another 10 minutes. It was good to be back in Irvine!
- Nav Night (Week 3) **my parents came** and there was a talk on Psalm 105:4 (how critical it is to lean on God for strength). Nav Night (week 4) we had a talk on God's call to go to the **nations**(Luke 24) and I got to play guitar for worship =].
- Funding Time!
- Just played disc golf with Rich and we are having a **talent show tonight**. I'm going to drum and share how big of an impact it has had on my life. People from FUV (students not a part of our program will be there!!).

Discipleship (One-on-ones)
------------
There is no real structure; but each week we go over a different topic with my team individually. The hope is that these concepts are simple and memorable so they can be passed on to others. Rich gave me a great idea to break up my time with into three parts. I've made it my own by having 1/3 checking in (to see how they are doing) and accountability of last week's goals 1/3 topic 1/3 applying the topic, making goals, and prayer. 

> 1/3 checking in, 1/3 topic, 1/3 goals and prayer

1. Quiet Time **Mark 1:35**
The heart behind quiet time is that we are in a relationship with God. We are in a commitment with him and he commands and commends us for spending time with him (Joshua 1:8). Through our quiet times we are making time for him. We are talking to him through prayer and listening to him through the Bible. We were taught in our team leader training about SOAP (Scripture, Observation, Application, and Prayer). It has made my quiet times more fruitful (learning and growing closer to God). Quiet times are something I do off and on; but the Navigators have a strong conviction that it is key to a joyful life. Jesus did it (Mark 1:35). I am working at it with these guys!

2. Promises **2 Peter 1:3-4**

>"Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires." - 2 Peter 1:4

Amongst doubting ourselves, being uncomfortable, being in pain, and fighting ourselves to do what is just and right; God has given us promises in the Bible we can cling to. This week we went over five promises and are memorizing them together. 

1. 1 John 5:11-12 - Assurance of Salvation
2. John 16:24 - Answered Prayer
3. 1 Corinthians 10:13 - Victory of Sin
4. 1 John 1:9 - Forgiveness
5. Proverbs 3:5-6 - Guidance

I've been resonating with Proverbs 3:5-6 and 1 John 1:9.

My Thoughts
-------------
Rich gave me an **evaluation** this week on our Bible study and my one-on-one. Rich said he enjoyed my questions, my accountability (confrontation is something I've been growing in this summer), and correction of false insight. He told me I could do better at presenting the **vision** of why we are together in both the Bible study and one-ones. He gave me some other ideas on how to improve. These things seem to be an art form and I want to continue to learn how to do them better =]. I think it'll ultimately make it more enjoyable and full. Rich was really gentle in his corrections and I felt encouraged after our time together.

My mentor from UCI came to visit last weekend. It was great getting to process all I've learned and what I've been struggling through. I also thanked him. It's cool how when we do things we gain a bigger appreciation for them. I really appreciate all he has done for me over the last three years =].

The 4th of July celebration was a lot fun in Fullerton. It was cool just hanging out with everyone: tossing the freebee, getting food, and watching fireworks.

Work has been pretty boring but I feel like I am having a significant role. One of my coworkers Brandan bought me lunch Wednesday =p. We've been having more meeting with our boss and just finished an application for our work. I've started to pray before work and it has helped remind me of my purpose in this place.

Last Words
-------------
My team wasn't very prepared for Bible study this week. I was super frustrated and was acted out very legalistically. Criticizing them for not doing it and not being patient enough to explain why I want them to do it. I wasn't concerned about their heart; I was more concerned with myself looking good. I apologized to them but felt guilty. 1 John 1:9 has given me a lot of comfort.

Now that we only have **two more weeks left** it is easy to think about the end. It's hard to be present, when you're tired, your getting more comfortable with people and you become less patient. I've been reminded by my friends here that God is working right here. I've been finding comfort in Proverbs 3:5-6.

Prayer
-------------

- Jobs. Neri and Kael are situated at Knott's. Kael got to share The Bridge verbally with a coworker. Macklin works in a mail room and started reading the Bible with his co worker Pablo. Macklin may get laid off today (it was only a temp position for a week). **Pray that he would be allowed to stay at the business**. Dean has been volunteering at an after school youth center for underprivileged kids. He has been loving it and feels a bond with the kids.
- Neri is struggling with why quiet times or reading the word daily is important. I would hope that we could figure this out; it's going to grow him so much closer to God. Joshua 1:8
- Fundraising! More people we willing to donate =] ($350 in total). LETS GO! Now all the guys are almost fully funded. Kael was told yesterday that he went from 53%-90% (he doesn't know who gave it to him) and was so excited to tell me. Thank you for all your sacrifices, you guys are being a huge blessing and are having a significant impact here. You are impacting everyone we interact with, impacting our relationships with God =].
- Unity in our team. I want our team to build one another up. That would be so powerful! Romans 15:1-6
